## 1. Uploading
Brain files should end in .vtp, and be placed in a folder.
Upload the folder, not the individual brain files.

## 2. Rating
If the structure of the brain looks good, press 1.
If it looks somewhat usuable, press 2.
If it looks usuable, press 3.
To go back to the previous brain and rated it again, press b.

Brain files that have already been rated will not show up.

## 3. Troubleshooting
Start with either Safari or Chrome. If one doesn't work, use the other.



2961 brains (all except one aphasia dataset) have been rated.
